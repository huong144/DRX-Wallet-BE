## Set JSON-RPC Endpoint

To make sure the transaction can be broadcast to network successfully, the BscGateway will use JSON-RPC Endpoint when sending transaction. Need to make sure this environment variable is set properly:

```
MAIN_NET_RPC_ENDPOINT=<Your RPC Endpoint here>

TEST_NET_RPC_ENDPOINT=<Your RPC Endpoint here>
```

```
